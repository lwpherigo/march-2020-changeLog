# may-2020-changeLog

#### Overview

This is a repo to track my progress in various areas, not just code. Initially it will just be for May, but potentially might extend longer. This is not a list of the individual courses taken, but a general checklist of daily progress. The quarantine lifestlye had me, admittedly, just... lethargic. Ready to make some progress. Started this progress tracker on May 4th, 2020.
